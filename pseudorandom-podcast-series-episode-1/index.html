          <p>The combination of my roommate starting a Rust podcast and a long, animated conversation with a (drunk) storyteller last night caused me to become suddenly enamored with the idea of starting my own lil&#8217; podcast. Lately I keep thinking about how many spontaneous, insightful conversations are never remembered, much less entombed in a publicly-accessible server for posterity. So a podcast seemed like an excellent way to share these moments without spending a lot of time writing (I&#8217;m a regrettably slow writer).Â I&#8217;dÂ simplyÂ bring folks into my warehouse living room, give them a beverage of their choice, and spend a leisurely hour chatting about whatever miscellaneous topics came to mind.</p>

<p>And so, wasting no time, today I asked my ex-ex-colleague Peter Eckersley if he would like to be my first podcast guest. Peter runs the technology projects team at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and, more importantly, lives 3 blocks away from me. Fortuitously,Â Peter agreed to have me over for a chat later this afternoon.</p>

<p>When I arrived, it turned out that one of Peter&#8217;s housemates was having friends over for dinner, so finding a quiet spot became a challenge. We ended up in a tiny room at the back of his house where every flat surface was covered in sewing equipment and sundry household items. As Peter grabbed a hammer to reconstruct the only available chair in the room, I set up my laptop and fancy (borrowed) podcast microphone. We gathered around as close as we could andÂ hit the record button.</p>

<p>Except forÂ one hiccup where Audacity decided to stop recording abruptly, the interview went smoothly and didn&#8217;t need much editing. Next time I&#8217;ll plan to put myself closer to the mic, do a longer intro, and maybe cut the length down to 15 minutes.</p>

<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/bcrypt/pseudorandom-podcast-episode-1" target="_blank">Here is the result</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, I had a fun time recording this podcast and am unduly excited about future episodes. Turns out a podcast takes ~10% of the time to write a blog post with the same content. ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>For this and future episodes in the Pseudorandom Podcast Series, here&#8217;s an <a href="http://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:156877463/sounds.rss" target="_blank">RSS feed</a>. I&#8217;m going to reach SoundCloud&#8217;s limit of 180 minutes real quick at this rate, so I will probably host these somewhere else in the future or start a microfunding campaign to pay $15/month.</p>

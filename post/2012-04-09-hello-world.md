so I don&#8217;t know whether to turn around at your doorway
  
so hesitation drips the milk from sore eyes
  
so I scratch the walls
  
so I peel flakes of plaster
  
tumble like dead moths
  
erode my fingernails
  
which have grown long and desperate like homeless shadows

before the sun rises
  
we dimple red sheets under hard white ceilings
  
limbs curled into smiles

and then we are chasing each other
  
canyons underfoot
  
dust and sky tangled in your hair
  
skin eating the sun
  
like a stick of yellow butter

the sky is heavy on our backs

back in your room
  
the walls crawl like hands of clocks
  
we dip fingers into skin and bone
  
draw each other close
  
like curtains in lamplight

and then I&#8217;m at the terminal
  
a mold of you blooming across my tired posture
  
as the janitor cleans
  
the floor on which I lie, hugging myself,
  
leaving an unvacuumed fetusprint on the carpet

I&#8217;m in Santa Barbara
  
The tides are coming fast
  
and I am running away from them into some kind of loneliness.

come
  
bring your
  
guitar strings and
  
unfinished crosswords and
  
laundry on the floor as teacups chatter impassively
  
a gigabyte of sunlight melting losslessly into red red shadows

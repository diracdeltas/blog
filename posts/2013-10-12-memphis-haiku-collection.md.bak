Tonight I found a collection of stupendously precocious (lolol) poems I wrote on a trip to Memphis at age 13. Here they are, untouched, in all their prematurely cynical glory:

> I&#8217;m going to Hell
  
> I mean Memphis, in two hours
  
> Do not raid my house.
> 
> If I don&#8217;t return
  
> Do not mope like Charlie Brown
  
> You&#8217;re not in my will.
> 
> I gave my pet bird
  
> To some short college student
  
> With lots of birdseed.
> 
> My root beer is flat
  
> I must have left it too long
  
> Is this relevant?
> 
> We are carpooling
  
> With some friend of my father&#8217;s
  
> Hope he pays for gas.
> 
> Going to find Elvis
  
> Because Lauren told me to
  
> Even though he&#8217;s dead.
> 
> Auditorium
  
> The word has five sylables
  
> I didn&#8217;t spell that right.
> 
> The smoky mountains
  
> Because only you can stop
  
> Those big forest fires.
> 
> At Holiday Inn
  
> They give you little bottles
  
> Of lousy shampoo.
> 
> Someone tell Kathy
  
> Of the YMCA band
  
> I can&#8217;t audition.
> 
> Chinese food is good
  
> Especially the sushi
  
> Wait, that&#8217;s Japanese.
> 
> They had a nurse shark
  
> But everyone thought it was a
  
> Mutant catfish.
> 
> Sushi bars are good
  
> And so is the free soy sauce there
  
> I spilled a bottle.
> 
> Graceland was real big
  
> But the tour guides were real dumb
  
> That&#8217;s why I got lost.
> 
> I did meet Elvis
  
> He was at his old garden
  
> Deep under the ground.
> 
> His airplane&#8217;s inside
  
> Was covered in plastic wrap
  
> Must have been itchy.
> 
> He had many suits
  
> All colors, jeweled and sequined
  
> Now worn by dummies.
> 
> The gift shop was cool
  
> A nice place to be until
  
> You saw the price tags.
> 
> I bought a milk-shake
  
> It had lots of iced vanilla
  
> My brain is frozen.
> 
> The hotel forgets
  
> To give me a bed at night.
  
> Now that is stupid.
> 
> I&#8217;d better go now
  
> It&#8217;s been great writing these, but
  
> The Simpsons is on.

_**that could have been us**_, 2015
  
 _Oil pastels, lipstick, eyeliner, cold medicine, and ballpoint pen on canvas._

i painted this while standing in my bathroom on valentine&#8217;s day&#8217;s night, unable to sleep and grotesquely feeling the weight of the oncoming dawn. it was my first time drawing on canvas.

as i worked, i kept thinking about all these people passing to and from doomed relationships, that feeling of being stupidly and everlastingly perched on the brink between hope and mutilation. that&#8217;s more or less what this is about.

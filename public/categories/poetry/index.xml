      <description>40 minutes in Tribeca on the way from Newtown to Boston
is all we have
before the parking meter runs out
so I transcribe the light of the setting sun in shorthand
(a cricket clutter of shutter clicks)
while you look for a bathroom.
the sun is running out
like a roll of toilet paper
waning into weary ribbons
as it soars toward heaven,
forgetful of the symmetries of the parabola,</description>

      <description>do you suffer from depression
i want to ask but meanwhile
electronic trance pours a silky tea into our ears
steeped in the red that pervades this room
here we are in San Francisco on a bright night
two people alone with our insomnia
blooming like violent wildflowers and loose lightning
our mouths draw the shapes of dim perceptions washed from a broken flow of melatonin
you spread over the sheets, skinny as daylight in winter,</description>

      <description>so I don&amp;#8217;t know whether to turn around at your doorway
so hesitation drips the milk from sore eyes
so I scratch the walls
so I peel flakes of plaster
tumble like dead moths
erode my fingernails
which have grown long and desperate like homeless shadows
before the sun rises
we dimple red sheets under hard white ceilings
limbs curled into smiles
and then we are chasing each other
canyons underfoot</description>

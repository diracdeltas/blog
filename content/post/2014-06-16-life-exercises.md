Every week, answer &#8220;yes&#8221; to one question that you would instinctively say no to.

Don&#8217;t spend money or sleep in a real bed for as long as possible.

Buy a pound of the ugliest paint that you can find.

Keep a journal of thoughts you avoid.

Block port 80 for a day.

Be kind at random.

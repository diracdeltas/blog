I wrote a Firefox addon one afternoon in France called TabStash. It&#8217;s quite simple: you click a button to close all your tabs except the current one. You click it again to open all of them. (Chrome has a popular extension called [OneTab][1] that does this, but at the time there wasn&#8217;t a Firefox version.)

A couple nights ago, I finally got around to sending it to the Mozilla addon store. It came out yesterday and already has some downloads, to my surprise.

Anyway, you can find it at <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tabstash/>.

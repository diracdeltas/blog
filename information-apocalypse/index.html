          <h5 id="date"> Mon Feb 19, 2018 </h5>
          <p>My friend <a href="http://aviv.me/">Aviv</a> was recently the subject of a popular <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/the-terrifying-future-of-fake-news">Buzzfeed
article</a> about the possibility of an impending &ldquo;information apocalypse&rdquo;. tl;dr: Aviv extrapolates from the fake news crisis that started in 2016 to a world in which anyone can create AI-assisted misinformation campaigns indistinguishable from reality to the average observer. From there, a series of possible dystopian scenarios arise, including:</p>

<ol>
<li>“Diplomacy manipulation,” in which someone uses deepfakes-style video
manipulation tools to produce a realistic video of a political leader
declaring war, in order to provoke their enemy into retaliation.</li>
<li>“Polity simulation,” where Congresspeople&rsquo;s inboxes are spammed with
messages from bots pretending to be their constituents.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Laser phishing,&rdquo; which improves the sophistication of phishing attacks by
training phishing email generators on messages from your real friends, so
you&rsquo;re more likely to read them and fall for them.</li>
</ol>

<p>With regards to how this would affect our everyday lives, Aviv postulates that exposure to a constant barrage of misinformation may lead to &ldquo;reality apathy&rdquo;; that is, people will start to assume that any information presented to them is untrustworthy and give up on finding the truth. In such a world, Aviv says, &ldquo;People stop paying attention to news and that fundamental level of informedness required for functional democracy becomes unstable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rest of this post consists of my half-formed thoughts on the possibility of reality apathy as it relates to existing technology, largely informed by my perspective working in the computer security industry.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the Internet of the late 90s and early 2000s. Back then, long before the 2016 fake news crisis, it was already possible to
bombard everyone on the Internet with well-crafted, believable misinformation. All you had to do was create a legitimate-looking website with a legitimate-looking domain name and then spread the link via chain emails. Case in
point: the first website that ever traumatized me as a kid was
something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonsai_Kitten">Bonsai
Kitten</a>. Complete with
realistic-looking photos of cute kittens contorted into various jars and vases, this
website completely fooled the 5th-grade me into believing that some unimaginably cruel person was raising and selling mutilated kittens. Apparently I wasn&rsquo;t the only one - the site drew hundreds of complaints a day from concerned animal-lovers and was the subject of an FBI investigation according to Wikipedia. Eventually Bonsai Kitten was debunked, and I&rsquo;m now friends with the creator of the site that once haunted my nightmares.</p>

<p>Another example of misinformation that people online have been exposed to since the dawn of the Internet is email-based phishing and spam. However, nowadays it is relatively difficult to create a successful bulk phishing/spam campaign, largely thanks to Google&rsquo;s improvements in spam filtering and Gmail&rsquo;s ever-increasing <a href="https://mako.cc/copyrighteous/google-has-most-of-my-email-because-it-has-all-of-yours">centralization</a> of email. As Mike Hearn describes in
great detail on the
<a href="https://moderncrypto.org/mail-archive/messaging/2014/000780.html">messaging@moderncrypto.org mailing list</a>, Google eventually &ldquo;won&rdquo; the spam
war by building a reputation system in which sender reputations could be
calculated faster than the attacker could game the system. Notably, this solution relied on both Gmail&rsquo;s ability to scan an incredibly large volume of plaintext email and their ability to broadly distinguish between legitimate Gmail users and bots trying to do Sybil attacks on the reputation scoring system.</p>

<p>How does this change in a world where phishing emails are generated by really
smart AIs? We might imagine that the content of these emails would do a much better job at fooling both humans clicking the spam/not-spam labels and Gmail&rsquo;s filter
algorithms into thinking that they aren&rsquo;t spam. However, the spammer would
still have to figure out a way of obtaining non-blacklisted sender IP
addresses, which can be done by signing up for a bunch of accounts with
a webmail service like Gmail (which Gmail tries to prevent, as Mike Hearn notes) or by taking over someone else&rsquo;s account and spamming their contacts.</p>

<p>The latter case may seem intractable. If a bot hacks my Gmail account,
uses my sent mail to train itself to generate emails that sound exactly like
me, and emails my friends asking them to send money to the hacker&rsquo;s Bitcoin
address, Gmail&rsquo;s spam filters are going to have a hard time figuring out that
those were not legitimate emails from me. On the other hand, I could have
prevented this from happening had I done a better job of securing my email
account. For these reasons, I consider email-based misinformation to be mostly a solved problem as long as Gmail&rsquo;s anti-spam team keeps doing their job, Google still controls the vast majority of email (ugh), and users can keep their accounts secured.</p>

<p>What about phishing websites, then? There are some incomplete defenses against those:</p>

<ol>
<li>Google SafeBrowsing is a service integrated into Chrome and other browsers
that contains a dynamic blacklist of &ldquo;bad&rdquo; domains, such as phishing sites
and sites distributing known malware. Browsers that enable SafeBrowsing will
show a warning before allowing a user to view a site on the SafeBrowsing
blacklist.</li>
<li>High-profile legitimate websites such as banks will often buy Extended
Validation TLS certificates, which require their organization to be
validated by the issuing certificate authority. In exchange, browsers show
a green bar in the URL bar next to the lock icon, usually containing the
name of the organization and the country code. However, it&rsquo;s relatively easy
to <a href="https://stripe.ian.sh/">game the validation process</a>, and it&rsquo;s unclear
how well this actually protects average users from
<a href="https://twitter.com/collinjackson/status/910537192702861312">real-life</a>
phishing attacks.</li>
</ol>

<p>On the other hand, the problem of determining whether a website is presenting
a distorted version of reality has some important differences from the problem of determining
whether a website is phishing/malware. For one, many people who have no
problems accepting Google&rsquo;s decision on whether a website is distributing
ransomware binaries would
<strong>not</strong> be happy if Google were the sole arbiter of whether news
stories were true or not. The occasionally-made argument that SafeBrowsing is a form of
censorship would apply much more cleanly if SafeBrowsing (or a similar megacorp-controlled service) also blacklisted sites that were ruled to be &ldquo;fake news&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So how do we protect people from believing fake news in a world where anyone can generate realistic-looking videos, images, and stories?</p>

<p>One idea I had brought up with Aviv was that web browsers or content
platforms like Facebook and YouTube could show a special UI indicator for media
and stories from reputable news sites, similar to how browsers show a green bar
for EV certificates and how Twitter/Facebook show a check mark next to
verified account names. For instance, videos that are approved as legitimate by the
Associated Press could be signed by a cryptographic key controlled by AP that
is preloaded into browsers. Then when the video is playing in someone&rsquo;s
Facebook news feed, the browser&rsquo;s trusted UI (for instance somewhere in
the URL bar) would display a popup informing the user that the video has been
approved by AP. This would however not prevent attacks where a Facebook user
makes up a fake caption (&ldquo;Trump declares war on Hawaii&rdquo;) for
a real image (an old photo of Trump speaking).</p>

<p>(Browsers and news reader apps could even add an optional &ldquo;trusted news mode&rdquo; where they only display media files that have been cryptographically signed by a reputable journalist organization. Unfortunately this would also block content from &ldquo;citizen journalists&rdquo; such as people livetweeting photos from a protest.)</p>

<p>To end on a more pessimistic note, I fear that we ultimately can&rsquo;t stop misinformation
campaigns from becoming rampant and normalized, not because of purely technological
reasons but because of psychological ones. During and in the wake of the 2016 Presidential
Election, a lot of the shares, likes, and retweets that I saw boiled down to people on both sides trying as hard as they could to reinforce
their existing beliefs. Social media, it turns out, is an excellent tool for
propagating &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; of what you believe, regardless of whether the evidence
is <a href="http://nymag.com/selectall/2018/02/hard-conservatives-share-the-most-fake-news-stories.html">real or
not</a>.</p>

<p>Fake news that is unpalatable (ex: Bonsai Kitten) stops spreading once it&rsquo;s
been debunked, but fake news that is <strong>crafted to be consistent with your desired
reality</strong> can keep getting views, shares, and clicks. Instead of reality apathy, we end up with pick-your-own-reality filter bubbles, in which people gather and amplify fake evidence for the reality that best suppports their underlying narrative. Instead of &ldquo;giving up&rdquo; on consuming information, people cherry-pick their information consumption based on feelings instead of fact, turning more and more online spaces into breeding grounds for extremism.</p>

<p>And so, maybe the majority of people wouldn&rsquo;t even want
SafeBrowsing-style blacklists of fake news sites or verification badges on
legitimate journalist-vetted news articles, because they&rsquo;re not reading
the news to learn the truth - they&rsquo;re reading the news to validate and spread their
existing worldviews.</p>

<p>Effectively this means that any technological solution to the information
apocalypse depends on a social/behavioral solution: people need to welcome
cognitive dissonance into their online spaces instead of shunning it.
But it sounds almost ridiculous to suggest that shares/likes/retweets should be based on factual accuracy, not emotions. That&rsquo;s not how social media works.</p>

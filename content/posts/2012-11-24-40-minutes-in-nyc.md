40 minutes in Tribeca on the way from Newtown to Boston
  
is all we have
  
before the parking meter runs out
  
so I transcribe the light of the setting sun in shorthand
  
(a cricket clutter of shutter clicks)
  
while you look for a bathroom.
  
the sun is running out
  
like a roll of toilet paper
  
waning into weary ribbons
  
as it soars toward heaven,
  
forgetful of the symmetries of the parabola,
  
the ache in the arms of your neighbor&#8217;s sycamore.

we leave with eight minutes to spare.
  
skeletons of metal and glass rip the skin of the sky,
  
autumn spread thick like marmalade
  
on this slice of highway.
  
the jar is running out
  
but the grocery store is closed. 

87% of bathrooms in Tribeca are for employees only.

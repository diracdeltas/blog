      <description>So it happens that every time you access a URL that starts with “http://”, anyone on your local network can see what you’re doing with almost no effort worth writing about. This includes the page itself as well as any information that you’re transferring, like credit card numbers and passwords (which are hopefully encrypted). It’s worth reiterating that this isn’t difficult at all, even if your network is WPA2-protected, as most supposedly-secure WiFi networks are nowadays.</description>

      <description>I’m just not that big a fan of usability, at least not for myself. To be clear, I do care about things being usable, but only enough to delay the eventual onslaught of social alienation. I drink water out of bowls, but only when the apartment is out of cups; I use xmonad as my window manager, but not at potlucks.
Thus far in my computer-using life, I’ve never owned a monitor.</description>

          <h5 id="date"> Sat Jul 20, 2013 </h5>
          <p>This morning, I found myself running down the middle of an empty highway in rural France at 5 AM. A litany of WTF&#8217;s rang through my head.</p>

<p>The sun rose, gently, turning attention to row upon row of freshly-cut crops stretching exorbitantly toward the horizon. Beyond softly rolling hills in the distance, there was the faint quilted pattern of a tiny village, cows and baguettes and all. Except for the thin ribbon of a two-lane highway, it was vague what century this place haunted.</p>

<p>I remember hypothesizing here a month ago, in the car-loathing aftermath of backseating several thousand miles around the US, that I was finally done with travelling for a while. I had just arrived back in San Francisco, unpacked my backpack, fixed my bike, and started interning at the EFF.</p>

<p>A week later, realizing that I could work remotely and that there were better places for human existence than 2 blocks from Market Avenue, I bought a plane ticket for Europe. I had hatched some sort of hazy half-plan to ditch the life I had constructed in SF and backpack around a continent that I had never visited, full of languages I couldn&#8217;t speak, until my visa ran out in 3 months&#8217; time. I would carry as little as possible, find like-minded hacker-type people to stay with, and spend most of my time writing code for the EFF, undeterred by distractions like understanding what other people were saying to me. Plus, since I wasn&#8217;t paying San Francisco cost-of-living prices and sold my Burning Man ticket, I would probably save money overall. Nothing could go wrong.</p>

<p>After sleeping through the entirety of the flight from SF to Paris while cradling a Kindle that I had intended to use, I unloaded myself into a subway at CDG, got off in the 6-euro-couscous-vendor district, and promptly reached the apartment of a Paris-dwelling ex-housemate who I barely saw the entire time. My impression of Paris from 2 days of aimless wandering is of a city whose historical and cultural significance is completely blighted by the lack of any usable WiFi except at McDonalds. I did not like Paris or find it fit for habitation, needless to say.</p>

<p>Fortunately I was rescued by a group of old friends, who invited me to stay and work with them in (1) a former convent turned into (2) an artist co-op / workspace owned by (3) a man with a pet peacock in (4) a tiny rural town in northern France. Several times a day, I will remember each of these four things in turn and suddenly feel like I&#8217;m dreaming.</p>

<p>This is my room:</p>

<p>And this is the view:</p>

<p>The night I arrived, we grilled meat and vegetables in the garden, with wine and baguettes aplenty.</p>

<p>The peacock made a cameo.</p>

<p>I took a wander around the convent and basked in its eccentricities.</p>

<p>I started settling into a routine after a couple days. It goes something like:</p>

<p>5 AM: Wake up</p>

<p>5:30 AM: Go for a run as the sun rises.</p>

<p>6:30 AM: Breakfast, shower, etc.</p>

<p>7 AM: Start work.</p>

<p>3 PM: Go to bed.</p>

<p>7 PM: Wake up, eat lots of baguette, start work again.</p>

<p>10 PM: Cook and eat dinner with friends.</p>

<p>11 PM: Try to work, mostly end up emailing/IRCing with people in the US who are now awake.</p>

<p>2 AM: Go to bed #2.</p>

<p>This is almost ideal, except that the only grocery store in town is 40 minutes away by foot and closed whenever I&#8217;m awake and not work-binging.</p>

<p>I like it here a lot. It&#8217;s quiet. There aren&#8217;t many people to talk to, since my friends are busy hacking away on a P2P video-sharing project all the time. I get to read a lot. Javascript has become fun &#8211; oh wait, maybe I have Stockholm Syndrome.</p>

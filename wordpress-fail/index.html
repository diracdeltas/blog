          <p>Update (5/28/14): Regrettably, most of the stories covering this blog post have been all &#8220;OMG EVERYTHING IS BROKEN&#8221; rather than &#8220;Here&#8217;s how to make things better til WordPress rolls out a fix&#8221; (which I humbly believe will take a while to *fully* fix, given that their SSL support is so patchy). So, given that most people reading this are probably coming from one of those articles, I think it&#8217;s important to start with the actionable items that people can do to mitigate cookie-hijacking attacks on WordPress:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you&#8217;re a developer running your own WordPress install, make sure you set up SSL on all relevant servers and configure WordPress to auth flag cookies as &#8220;secure.&#8221;</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re a WordPress user, don&#8217;t be logged into WordPress on an untrusted network, or use a VPN. If you are and you visit a wordpress.com site (which confusingly may not actually have a wordpress.com domain name), your auth cookies are exposed.</li>
<li>[Experimental, probably not recommended] You can manually set the &#8220;secure&#8221; flag on the WP auth cookies in your browser. There&#8217;s no guarantee that this works consistently, since the server can always send a set-cookie that reverts it into an insecure cookie. It may cause some WP functionality to break.</li>
<li>If you suspect that your WP cookie may have been stolen in the past, you can invalidate it by (1) waiting 3 years for it to expire on the server or (2) resetting your wordpress.com password. Note that logging out of WordPress does *not* invalidate the cookie on the server, so someone who stole it can use it even after you&#8217;ve logged out. I verified that resetting your WP password does invalidate the old cookie; there may be other ways, but I haven&#8217;t found any.</li>
</ol>

<p>Original post below.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>While hunting down a bug report for <a href="https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox">Privacy Badger</a>, I noticed the &#8220;wordpress_logged_in&#8221; cookie being sent over clear HTTP to a WordPress authentication endpoint (<a href="http://r-login.wordpress.com/remote-login.php">http://r-login.wordpress.com/remote-login.php</a>) on someone&#8217;s blog.</p>

<div id="attachment_377" style="width: 904px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
  <a href="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress_cookies.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-377" src="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress_cookies.png" alt="uh-oh" width="894" height="864" srcset="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress_cookies.png 894w, https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress_cookies-300x289.png 300w, https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress_cookies-624x603.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 894px) 100vw, 894px" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">

</div>

<p>Sounds like bad news! As mom always said, you should set the &#8220;secure&#8221; flag on sensitive cookies so that they&#8217;re never sent in plaintext.</p>

<p>To check whether this cookie did anything interesting, I logged out of my wordpress account, copied the wordpress_logged_in cookie into a fresh browser profile, and visited <a href="http://wordpress.com">http://wordpress.com</a> in the new browser profile. Yep, I was logged in!</p>

<p>This wouldn&#8217;t be so bad if the wordpress_logged_in cookie were invalidated when the original user logged out or logged back in, but it definitely still worked. Does it expire? In 3 years. (Not sure when it gets invalidated on the server side, haven&#8217;t waited long enough to know.)</p>

<p>Is this as bad as sending username/password in plaintext? I tried to see if I could reset the original user&#8217;s password.</p>

<p><a href="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpresspassword1-e1400805127825.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-378" src="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpresspassword1-e1400805127825.png" alt="wordpresspassword1" width="992" height="428" srcset="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpresspassword1-e1400805127825.png 992w, https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpresspassword1-e1400805127825-300x129.png 300w, https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpresspassword1-e1400805127825-624x269.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 992px" /></a></p>

<p>That didn&#8217;t work, so I&#8217;m assuming WordPress uses the actually-secure cookie (wordpress_sec) for super important operations like password change. Nice job, but &hellip;</p>

<p>It turns out I could post to the original user&#8217;s blog (and create new blog sites on their behalf):</p>

<p><a href="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress_postblog-e1400805350246.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-379" src="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress_postblog-e1400805350246.png" alt="wordpress_postblog" width="928" height="581" srcset="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress_postblog-e1400805350246.png 928w, https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress_postblog-e1400805350246-300x187.png 300w, https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress_postblog-e1400805350246-624x390.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 928px) 100vw, 928px" /></a></p>

<p>I could see private posts:</p>

<p><a href="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress_postsecretblog-e1400805413834.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-380" src="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress_postsecretblog-e1400805413834.png" alt="wordpress_postsecretblog" width="950" height="523" srcset="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress_postsecretblog-e1400805413834.png 950w, https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress_postsecretblog-e1400805413834-300x165.png 300w, https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress_postsecretblog-e1400805413834-624x343.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px" /></a></p>

<p>I could post comments on other blogs as them:</p>

<p><a href="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress_postcomment-e1400805499342.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-381" src="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress_postcomment-e1400805499342.png" alt="wordpress_postcomment" width="1007" height="534" srcset="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress_postcomment-e1400805499342.png 1007w, https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress_postcomment-e1400805499342-300x159.png 300w, https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress_postcomment-e1400805499342-624x330.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1007px) 100vw, 1007px" /></a></p>

<p>I could see their blog stats:</p>

<p><a href="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress_stats-e1400805571221.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-382" src="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress_stats-e1400805571221.png" alt="wordpress_stats" width="1042" height="695" srcset="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress_stats-e1400805571221.png 1042w, https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress_stats-e1400805571221-300x200.png 300w, https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress_stats-e1400805571221-1024x682.png 1024w, https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress_stats-e1400805571221-624x416.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1042px) 100vw, 1042px" /></a></p>

<p>And so forth. I couldn&#8217;t do some blog administrator tasks that required logging in again with the username/password, but still, not bad for a single cookie.</p>

<p>Moral of the story: don&#8217;t visit a WordPress site while logged into your account on an untrusted local network.</p>

<p>Update: Thanks to Andrew Nacin of WordPress for informing me that auth cookies will be invalidated after a session ends in the next WordPress release and that SSL support on WordPress will be improving!</p>

<p>Update (5/26/14): I subsequently found that the insecure cookie could be used to set someone&#8217;s 2fac auth device if they hadn&#8217;t set it, thereby locking them out of their account. If someone has set up 2fac already, the attacker can still bypass login auth by cookie stealing &#8211; the 2fac auth cookie is also sent over plaintext.</p>

<p>Update (5/26/14): A couple people have asked about whether the disclosure timeline below is reasonable, and my response is <a href="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wordpress-fail/#comment-70">here</a>.</p>

<p>Disclosure timeline:</p>

<p>Wed, 21 May 2014 16:12:17 PST: Reported issue to security@automattic.com, per the instructions at <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/#where-do-i-report-security-issues">http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/#where-do-i-report-security-issues</a>; at this point, the report was mostly out of courtesy, since I figured it had to be obvious to them and many WP users already that the login cookie wasn&#8217;t secured (it&#8217;s just a simple config setting in WordPress to turn on the secure cookie flag, as I understand it). Received no indication that the email was received.</p>

<p>22 May 2014 16:43: Mentioned the lack of cookie securing publicly. <a href="https://twitter.com/bcrypt/status/469624500850802688">https://twitter.com/bcrypt/status/469624500850802688</a></p>

<p>22 May 2014 17:39: Received response from Andrew Nacin (not regarding lack of cookie securing but rather that the auth cookie lifetime will soon be that of a regular session cookie). <a href="https://twitter.com/nacin/status/469638591614693376">https://twitter.com/nacin/status/469638591614693376</a></p>

<p>23 May 2014 ~13:00: Discovered two-factor auth issue on accident, reported to both security@automattic.com and security@wordpress.org in reply to original email. I also mentioned it to Dan Goodin since I found the bug while trying to answer a question he had about cookies, but I did not disclose publicly.</p>

<p>25 May 2014 15:20: Received email response from security@automattic.com saying that they were looking into it internally (no mention of timeline). Wrote back to say thanks.</p>

<p>26 May 2014, ~10:00: Ars Technica article about this gets published, which mentioned the 2-fac auth issue. I updated this blog post to reflect that.</p>

<p>26-27 May 2014: Some commenters on the Ars Technica article discover an arguably worse bug than the one that the original article was about: WordPress sends the login form over HTTP. (Even though the form POST is over HTTPS, the local network attacker can modify the target on the HTTP page however he/she wants and then it&#8217;s game over.) This wouldn&#8217;t be so bad if everyone used a password manager and changed passwords semi-regularly, since most people are likely to login to WordPress through their blog&#8217;s admin portal (which is always HTTPS as far as I can tell), except that password reuse is rampant. Robert Graham subsequently published <a href="http://blog.erratasec.com/2014/05/wordpress-unsafe-at-any-speed.html">this blog post</a>.</p>

<p>29 May 2014, 5:52: Received reply from WordPress saying they would email me again when fixed.</p>

<p>30 May 2014, 14:51: Andrew Nacin says all issues are supposedly fixed.</p>

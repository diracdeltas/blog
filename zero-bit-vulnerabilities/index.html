          <p>The other day, I overheard Seth Schoen ask the question, &#8220;What is the smallest change you can make to a piece of software to create a serious vulnerability?&#8221; We agreed that one bit is generally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-by-one_error#Fencepost_error" target="_blank">sufficient</a>; for instance, in x86 assembly, the operations JL and JLE (corresponding to &#8220;jump if less than&#8221; and &#8220;jump if less than or equal to&#8221;) are represented by:</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>and the difference between the two could very easily cause serious problems via memory corruption or otherwise. As a simple human-understandable example, imagine replacing &#8220;&lt;&#8221; with &#8220;&lt;=&#8221; in a bus ticket machine that says: &#8220;if ticket_issue_date &lt; today, reject rider; else allow rider.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point, I started feeling one-bit-upsmanship and wondered whether there was such a thing as a zero-bit vulnerability. Obviously, a binary that is &#8220;safe&#8221; on one machine can be malicious on a different machine (ex: if the second machine has been infected with malware), so let&#8217;s require that the software must be non-vulnerable and vulnerable on two machines that start in identical states. For simplicity, let&#8217;s also require that both machines are perfectly (read: unrealistically) airgapped, in the sense that there&#8217;s no way for them to change state based on input from other computers.</p>

<p>This seems pretty much impossible to me unless we consider vulnerabilities probabilistically generated by environmental noise during code execution. Two examples for illustration:</p>

<ol>
<li>A program that behaves in an unsafe way if the character &#8220;A&#8221; is output by a random character generator that uses true hardware randomness (ex: quantum tunneling rates in a semiconductor).</li>
<li>A program that behaves in an unsafe way when there are single-bit flips due to radioactive decay, cosmic ray collisions, background radiation, or other particle interactions in the machine&#8217;s hardware. It turns out that these are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_error#Causes_of_soft_errors" target="_blank">well-known</a> and have, in some historical cases, caused actual problems. In 2000, Sun <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/03/07/sun_suffers_ultrasparc_ii_cache/" target="_blank">reportedly</a> received complaints from 60 clients about an error caused by background radiation that flipped, on average, <a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1839574" target="_blank">one bit per processor per year</a>! (In other words, Sun suffers due to sun.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Which brings up a fun hypothetical question: if you design an SSL library that will always report invalid certificates as valid if ANY one bit in the library is flipped (but behaves correctly in the absence of single-bit flip errors), have you made a zero-bit backdoor?</p>

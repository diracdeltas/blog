  <p>Dear Chelsea,</p>
<p>You probably don’t remember me, but we met in September 2009. This was before everyone knew your name and before many people knew mine.</p>
<p>I was at home, helping my friend cut her hair. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw you walk into the living room. You were taking photos of our mural-covered walls, seemingly happy to be in such a bizarre and interesting house of MIT students. Someone introduced you to me.</p>
<p>That evening, or perhaps the evening after, I learned that you were a soldier training for Iraq. You wanted to leave the military someday and get a degree in Computer Science. You weren’t much older than me, but you sounded more anxious and weary than anyone I’d ever met before. We chatted for a while, and then I had to go finish my homework.</p>
<p>You left Boston soon after that, and you friended me on Facebook. I accepted your friend request, and that was the last time we interacted with each other.</p>
<p>When you were arrested in 2010, I was proud of what you’d done and angry at what happened to you after (I still am, every day). At the same time, the media <a href="http://tech.mit.edu/V130/N30/wikileaks.html" target="_blank">started suspecting</a> (baselessly) that friends of mine had assisted you in whistleblowing. For the first time in my life, I felt like I might be under more surveillance than the average 18 year-old.</p>
<p>It was then that I realized that although I hadn’t done anything wrong, I had reason to be distrustful of the government that I lived under. I had nothing to hide, but nonetheless I was now part of a community under suspicion of a serious crime.</p>
<p>I started learning about security and privacy. Soon after, I installed PGP and started using it. Years later, I still think of you every time I help others encrypt their communications.</p>
<p>So thanks for teaching me how to be paranoid. Thanks for showing me why everyone should care about surveillance, even if they aren’t a whistleblower. Meeting you was an accident that could have happened to anyone. I’m glad it happened to me.</p>
<p>Happy 28th Birthday.</p>
<p>-Yan</p>

i&#8217;ve finally recovered enough from a multi-week bout of sickness to say some things and put up some photos. lately i&#8217;ve felt exhausted and lethargic and unproductive to be honest. being sick probably had something to do with it; i sure hope next week gets better.

yesterday, someone told me they had a theory that everyone who sleeps at night (with rare exceptions) can only manage ~3 significant life events at a time. that sounds about right, but it feels like a lot has been going on. a partial, unordered list:

1. talked yesterday at the Yahoo Trust Unconference about [the future of email security][1]

2. working on graceful degradation of hopes and feelings

3. writing software for Let&#8217;s Encrypt as an EFF Technology fellow

4. trying to make sane w3c standards with these fine folks from the W3C Technical Architecture group

5. packing bag(s) and moving to a new neighborhood (twice)

6. finding balance on a skateboard and otherwise

&#8220;I think emotional and crypto intelligence are severely underrated&#8221; &#8211; spectator at the Yahoo Trust Unconference.

My name is yan but I also go by [bcrypt][2] and [azuki][6]. I used to work at the [Electronic Frontier Foundation][4] on privacy-enhancing technology; now I do security engineering at [Brave][5]. In a long-forgotten past life, I studied physics at MIT.

This blog mainly serves as a place for me to practice writing and remember
snapshots of my life over the years, but occasionally I post technical content
that may interest a couple other people.

## Software:

Some highlights are listed on [my homepage][3]. Pretty much everything is <a href="https://github.com/diracdeltas" target="_blank">open source</a>.

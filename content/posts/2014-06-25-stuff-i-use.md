This was my favorite part of [my interview][1] with The Setup:

> #### What would be your dream setup?
> 
> Let&#8217;s start with the easy ones. I would like (1) an e-book reader that has the portability and battery life of a Kindle, runs free software out-of-the-box, and doesn&#8217;t support DRM; (2) an open-source maps application for [Android][2]/CyanogenMod that can provide biking and public transit directions for any city that I happen to be in; and (3) a usable open-source password manager that syncs to mobile devices, integrates with browsers, and meets some set of minimum security requirements. (I&#8217;ll work on the latter if someone else does the first two.)
> 
> Slightly more ambitious: every device should come with root access for the user if they want it. Going down the stack, it would be nice if all computing devices by default ran a [free BIOS][3] and other free firmware on top of easily-modifiable, open hardware.
> 
> Respecting the autonomy of users by allowing them to understand and modify their devices is crucial for creating widespread technical literacy and, subsequently, a world in which ordinary people can detect when their rights are being threatened by technology providers and governments. I have a crazy dream that, someday, ordinary families will sit down at their kitchen tables to install software updates together and read the change logs aloud over breakfast.
> 
> Shooting for the stars now: let&#8217;s design computers so that software engineering doesn&#8217;t force us to occupy constrained, mostly-immobile positions in florescent-lit rooms for 8+ hours every day. I&#8217;d like to code and go backpacking at the same time.

<p>lately i have been doing some lazy baking whilst in quarantine, where lazy is
defined as:</p>
<ul>
<li>no need for fancy equipment like stand mixers with dough hooks</li>
<li>NO STARTERS (like the kind you need for making sourdough)</li>
<li>less than one hour of work total</li>
<li>can be made by a beginner with almost no cooking experience</li>
<li>can skip/improvise/fuckup 1-2 steps and still have a decent result</li>
</ul>
<p>for a prime example of lazy baking, check out my <a href="https://twitter.com/bcrypt/status/1248342621790949376">twitter recipe
thread</a> about
japanese-style croissants (AKA salted butter rolls), which have been made by
dozens of people (including children) to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CAA9Q_GpZBH/">near-universal
acclaim</a>.</p>

<h2 id="non-lazy-bagels">non-lazy bagels</h2>
<p>when lazy croissants became overly undemanding of my copious leisure time
(jk), i decided to move on to bagels with some
encouragement from baking master and sourdough-starter-haver
<a href="https://twitter.com/garrettr_/status/1257401082235490306">garrett</a>. these sourdough bagels were incredible, but required having a sourdough starter and
clearing an empty fridge shelf to put the bagels in overnight, hence
disqualifying them from my laziness requirement.</p>

<p>having said that, if you have access to a sourdough starter, you should
probably just stop reading here and <a href="https://www.baked-theblog.com/new-york-style-sourdough-bagels-with-roasted-garlic-labneh/">go make this sourdough bagel recipe
instead</a>.</p>
<h2 id="lazy-bagels">lazy bagels</h2>
<p>my goal was to make a lazy bagel that was 90% as good as the average nyc bagel. it had to be pillowy yet able to withstand a cream-cheese laden butter knife without getting crushed, with a chewy exterior and a nice yeasty flavor that would make keto people hate me.</p>
<p>i think i achieved this - or at least what is probably the best bagel i&rsquo;ve had
outside of the east coast - by making a few modifications to
a tried-and-true recipe from <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/homemade-bagels/">Sally&rsquo;s Baking
Addiction</a>. so far i&rsquo;ve
made two batches of my favorite bagel flavor, parmesan-onion-garlic, one
with parmesan inside the dough and one without. both have turned out
sufficiently spectacular that i am taking the time to write this down for
posterity even though my blog auto-deploy scripts are broken.</p>
<h3 id="equipment">equipment</h3>

<li>parchment paper or silicone baking mats</li>
<li>a pot that holds at least 2qts</li>
<li>[optional] pastry brush</li>
<li>thermometer</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ingredients">ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>500g (4c) all-purpose or bread flour</li>
<li>8g (2.75tsp) yeast</li>
<li>butter or oil spray for coating</li>
<li>12g (2tsp) salt</li>
<li>1/4c + 1tbsp maple syrup, brown sugar, or honey</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="day-1-instructions">day 1 instructions</h3>
<p>do these the night before you want to eat bagels</p>
<h4 id="making-alkalized-baking-soda">making alkalized baking soda</h4>
<p>the purpose of this step is to <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/expert-bagel-maker-confirms-you-dont-need-lye-to-make-a-good-bagel-maker-tour-203288">increase the
potency</a> of commercial baking soda
so that you can use it in place of lye to boil bagels.</p>
<ol>
<li>preheat an oven to 275F</li>
<li>line a baking sheet with aluminum foil</li>
<li>pour a bunch of baking soda (at least 1/4c, do more if you want to save some
for next time) onto the foil in a layer</li>
<li>bake the baking soda for an hour; then store it in a sealed jar or ziplock
bag</li>
</ol>
<p>be careful when handling the baking soda after baking as it is strong enough to
cause skin irritation.</p>
<h4 id="making-the-dough">making the dough</h4>
<ol>
<li>pour 1.5 cups of water into a small bowl &amp;  microwave for ~40s until it reaches 100-110F (38-43C)</li>
<li>sprinkle 8g yeast into the water and whisk it around until it dissolves.
add 1 tbsp maple syrup (or brown sugar, or honey) into the yeast water and stir
to combine.</li>
<li>measure 500g flour and 12g salt into a very large bowl. if you want a cheesy
dough, add 1/2 cup of shredded parmesan. mix it all up.</li>
<li>pour the wet mixture into the flour mixture and mix it up evenly with your
hands.</li>
<li>dust some flour onto a work surface (like a counter or chopping board), then
pour your dough onto the surface</li>
<li>knead the dough for about 10min, sprinkling more flour onto the dough if it
is sticking to your hands or the surface. i like to fold the dough onto itself,
press down hard to flatten it, fold, press, repeat. at the end of this
process, you should have a stiff ball of dough that barely sticks:
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/549654/81510470-bd941580-92c6-11ea-943a-d0770d91e20c.jpg" alt="doughball" title="dough ball"></li>
<li>grease or oil spray the bowl that your dough was in. put your dough ball
back into the bowl and flip it around to coat in oil/butter. cover it (i
like to use plastic wrap with a towel on top) and
let it sit out for 60-90min. at the end it should look puffier like this:
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/549654/81510464-b40aad80-92c6-11ea-938f-7134501d83db.jpg" alt="dough" title="dough"></li>
<li>put your bowl of covered dough in the fridge to rest overnight</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="day-2-instructions">day 2 instructions</h3>
<p>your dough should have risen a bunch in the fridge and may now look ugly like
this:
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/549654/81510458-aa814580-92c6-11ea-8352-5db7d7f0df1f.jpg" alt="dough nextday" title="dough next day"></p>
<ol>
<li>split your dough into 8 roughly-equal balls</li>
<li>taking one ball of dough at a time, flatten the ball into a disk, then roll
it up into a long log shape. put 3 fingers on top of the log, then wrap the
dough around your fingers so about 2 inches overlap. then roll the dough
seam so that it looks like a continuous ring of dough as shown below.
<img src="https://www.baked-theblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/My-Post-1024x683.jpg" alt="doughshaping" title="dough shaping"></li>
<li>place the shaped dough onto baking sheets lined with silicone mats or
parchment paper. cover again and let rise at room temperature for up to an
hour.</li>
<li>in the meantime, preheat the oven to 425F. prep your bagel toppings and
egg wash. to make egg wash (optional but recommended), whisk together 1 egg
yolk and a splash of milk/cream/water.</li>
<li>in a large pot, bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. add 2 tbsp of the
alkalized baking powder and 1/4 cup of maple syrup (or honey, or brown sugar).
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/549654/81510450-9b01fc80-92c6-11ea-8d50-6a0e4b18e3de.jpg" alt="doughbath" title="dough bath"></li>
<li>carefully drop in 2-4 bagels at a time. they should float to the top of the water. let
them boil for 30s to 1m on one side until a fried-looking layer forms, then
flip them over and repeat for the other side.
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/549654/81510448-98070c00-92c6-11ea-9ba2-68bc62c3ff89.jpg" alt="boiling" title="boiling"></li>
<li>when you have boiled the bagels on both sides, carefully remove them from
the water with a slotted spoon and place on a plate. brush them with egg
wash if using.

<li>top generously with toppings
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/549654/81510509-04820b00-92c7-11ea-86b0-bb7efbfa0068.jpg" alt="toppings" title="toppings"></li>
<li>place the bagels back on the lined baking sheets and bake for 20min or until
they turn golden brown.</li>
</ol>
<p>here&rsquo;s my first batch without parmesan in the dough, on the slightly
less-cooked end at ~19min (how i prefer bagels):
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/549654/81510479-c8e74100-92c6-11ea-9895-ed169d7dc127.jpg" alt="less donebagels" title="less done bagels"></p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s bagels at ~21min, which is how most people seem to prefer bagels:
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/549654/81510499-e9170000-92c6-11ea-996c-ee2dfbb281cf.jpg" alt="more donebagels" title="more done bagels"></p>
<p>the next day, they were still really soft with a nice density and bite:
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/549654/81510474-c08f0600-92c6-11ea-9b41-b129e20fdd14.jpg" alt="day after bagels1" title="day after bagels 1">
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/549654/81510472-bf5dd900-92c6-11ea-9843-d79fd898c092.jpg" alt="day after bagels2" title="day after bagels 2"></p>
<p>for comparison, here&rsquo;s a fresh-out-of-the-oven picture from my 2nd batch which used bread flour instead of AP and had parmesan mixed into the dough. the
dough was a lot stickier and harder to work with due to the cheese (hence some of the uglier photos
above), and the end
result might be considered not-a-proper-bagel by bagel snobs. however
i guarantee it is still tastier than almost any bagel you can find on the west
coast.

<p>happy experimenting!</p>

do you suffer from depression
  
i want to ask but meanwhile
  
electronic trance pours a silky tea into our ears
  
steeped in the red that pervades this room

here we are in San Francisco on a bright night
  
two people alone with our insomnia
  
blooming like violent wildflowers and loose lightning

our mouths draw the shapes of dim perceptions washed from a broken flow of melatonin

you spread over the sheets, skinny as daylight in winter,
  
stare at me upside-down.
  
listen carefully
  
to me speak of depth perception
  
as you suck nitrous oxide into your lungs like grenade smoke.

later we lie next to each other, pointlessly,
  
coaxing sleep into the room with crumbs of prayer
  
perhaps i kneel at the threshold of consciousness
  
building churches out of slender touch, parsimonious and fragile.

for hours, you traced circles on my skin
